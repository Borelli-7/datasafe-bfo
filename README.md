This is the Datasafe GitHub pages branch.

To test your changes using local deployment you can follow these steps:
1. Go to `developing` directory
1. Build `jekyll` docker image using `build.sh`
1. Launch it in docker using `serve.sh` - it will launch the container with webserver, 
its output will show you which URL to open (something like http://0.0.0.0:4000/pages/adorsys/datasafe/)

If you follow these steps, you will be able to check your local changes in WYSIWYG mode.
